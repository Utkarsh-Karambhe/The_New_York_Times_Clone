## 🎯 Objective

This submission is a **pixel-perfect recreation** of the homepage of **The New York Times**, built fully in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — all in a single HTML file as per the competition rules. The clone replicates typography, layout, spacing, and responsiveness down to the finest detail.

## 🌟 What's Included

✅ **Perfect visual fidelity** — fonts, spacing, layout, icons, and UI structure  
✅ **Fully responsive** across mobile, tablet, and desktop  
✅ **No backend used**, mock data + images only  
✅ **All code written by me** (inline CSS + JS), not auto-generated by LLMs  
✅ **Hosted and tested** for speed, UX, and pixel precision
