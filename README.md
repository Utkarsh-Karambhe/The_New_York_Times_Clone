## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer  
üìå **Important Note Regarding Repo Visibility & Clones**

This GitHub repository was created and made public on **April 20th, 2025 at 2:00 PM IST** to host my submission for the **Pixel Plus Hackathon 2025**. Shortly after uploading, I noticed unexpected clone activity (**25+ unique clones within hours**), which concerned me.

As soon as I realized the exposure risk, I made the repository **private immediately** to preserve the originality and integrity of my work.

üîê **This project is 100% original and built entirely by me from scratch.** All enhancements and replication efforts were done manually with attention to detail, without copying or reusing others‚Äô code.
